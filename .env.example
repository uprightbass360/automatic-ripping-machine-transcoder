# ARM Transcoder Environment Configuration
# Copy this file to .env and customize for your environment

# ========== TIMEZONE ==========
TZ=America/New_York

# ========== USER/GROUP IDS ==========
# Match these to your ARM container for consistent file permissions
ARM_UID=1001
ARM_GID=1000

# ========== NFS PATHS ==========
# These paths should be NFS mounts shared between ARM ripper and transcoder
# Based on your ARM_MEDIA_PATH, the raw files will be in a subdirectory
NFS_RAW_PATH=/nfs/files/Video/Import/raw
NFS_COMPLETED_PATH=/nfs/files/Video/Import/completed

# ========== LOCAL PATHS ==========
# Working directory for transcoding (local SSD recommended for speed)

# Quality (CRF-like): lower = better quality, larger file
# Recommended: 18-22 for NVENC, 20-24 for software
VIDEO_QUALITY=22

# Audio: copy (passthrough), aac, ac3, eac3
AUDIO_ENCODER=copy

# Subtitles: all, none, first

# ========== PERFORMANCE ==========
# Max concurrent transcodes (1 for single GPU)
MAX_CONCURRENT=1

# Seconds to wait for source folder to stabilize before transcoding
STABILIZE_SECONDS=60

# ========== LOGGING ==========
LOG_LEVEL=INFO

# ========== ARM RIPPER (if running alongside) ==========
